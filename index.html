            For the past thirty years, I have advocated on behalf of individuals
            and corporations in a myriad of contexts. I’ve associated with firms
            and companies of various sizes and, in those roles, I’ve argued
            issues and cases in a number of different legal settings.<br />I’ve
            won bench and jury trial verdicts, argued successful motions,
            drafted winning briefs, and prevailed in arbitration. I’ve counseled
            on litigation as an in-house attorney and I’ve assisted clients in
            negotiating optimal settlements, both in direct negotiations and
            with the participation of party neutrals.<br />I started GoodmanPark
            Law in 2020 to assist individuals, law firms, and other legal
            service organizations with their advocacy needs.
