              For the past thirty years, I have advocated on behalf of
              individuals and corporations in a myriad of contexts. I’ve
              associated with firms and companies of various sizes and, in those
              roles, I’ve argued issues and cases in a number of different legal
              settings.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve won bench and jury trial verdicts, argued successful motions,
              drafted winning briefs, and prevailed in arbitration. I’ve
              counseled on litigation as an in-house attorney and I’ve assisted
              clients in negotiating optimal settlements, both in direct
              negotiations and with the participation of party neutrals.

              I started GoodmanPark Law in 2020 to assist individuals, law

                  Over the course of my career, my passion has been the pro bono
                  work I've done, representing immigrants in various “fear of
                  return” proceedings before the USCIS and IJs. I won my first
                  Asylum case in 1996 and I’m thrilled to be able to devote more
                  of my time to this area of the law. I have represented
                  immigrants in a variety of matters including:

                  I began my career as an associate attorney in the litigation
                  department of a mid-sized regional law firm. After several
                  years there, I moved on to a series of increasingly greater
                  leadership roles at a captive commercial litigation operation
                  which eventually became known as Siegal & Park. Over the
                  decades there, I mediated, arbitrated, and tried a variety of
                  cases. For part of my career, I also worked as an in-house
                  litigation attorney, overseeing complex coverage matters as a
                  Vice President of a large, multinational insurance company.
